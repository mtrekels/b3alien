## Introduction

The historic Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity
Framework, which supports the achievement of the
Sustainable Development Goals and builds on the
Convention on Biological Diversity’s (CBD) previous
Strategic Plans, sets out an ambitious pathway to reach
the global vision of a world living in harmony with nature
by 2050. Among the Framework’s key elements are 23
targets for 2030. In order to track the progress on the
targets, a number of indicators were agreed upon for
each target. The B3ALIEN software provides a technical
solution to track Target 6: “Reduce the Introduction of
Invasive Alien Species by 50% and Minimize Their
Impact.” It mainly focusses on the headline indicator: rate
of invasive alien species establishment, but can provide
input to some of the complementary indicators.

Decision makers at local, regional, national and
international levels need accurate and reliable
information about status, trends, threats, and they need
data presented in an actionable and understandable
format, with measures of uncertainty. Furthermore, we
need synthesized data products that can be combined
with other environmental data, such as climate, soil
chemistry, land use, altitude... B3ALIEN is built upon the
concept of data cubes developed in the Horizon Europe
Biodiversity Building Blocks for Policy project (b-
cubed.eu). It uses the solid foundations of the GBIF
infrastructure, where tools such as the GBIF Taxonomic
Backbone and the Global Registry of Introduced and
Invasive Species are available by default. Readily available occurrence data is used to determine and estimate
accurately the rate of introduction of alien species..
